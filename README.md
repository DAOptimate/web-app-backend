# Web App Backend

This is a [NestJS](http://nestjs.com/) app to receive contact form submissions and store them in a MySQL database.

## Running Locally

You'll need to have docker installed to run the database container and pnpm to install the project dependencies.

```bash
# install dependencies
$ pnpm install

# start the development database
$ docker compose up

# start the app in development mode
$ pnpm start:dev
```
